#Phone call

m "Fighting back my bad feeling, I decided to call Maverick."

"Luckily his number was still saved in the list of missed calls"

Mv "So our oh-so-important guest is actually calling me. {w} I don’t trust you and your buddy Reza but if you are willing to talk to me then I’m willing to listen."

Mv "However, if this is a scheme to get me out of the way then you’re going to regret it."

m "Maverick then gave me the details for our meeting."

m "Suddenly, I wasn’t so sure if meeting Maverick was such a good idea but it was too late to back out now. "

m "Despite my best efforts, Sebastian insisted to escorting me to my meeting. Deep down I was glad he was there but I still feared that it might prevent Maverick from appearing."

m "I promised him a meeting with just the two of us after all."

m "When we arrived at the place Maverick mentioned, I was making my way to the park benches while Sebastian stayed behind."

m "That way Maverick and I could talk without him listening to us but was still able to see our meeting place in case of Maverick trying to do something. "

m "Although there were some trees at this part of Tatsu Park, there weren’t many hiding places for me if things went wrong."

m "On the other hand, that might have been Maverick’s plan because it would also prevent Reza from hiding here."

m "For Maverick, I still was Reza’s accomplice after all."

m "I sat down on a bench and started to wait for Maverick. Tatsu Park was unusually quiet and I didn’t see any other people around."

m "It took a few minutes until I heard a sound behind me and when I turned around I saw Maverick landing."

m "His intense gaze rested on me while he stepped closer."

m "Even with the Sebastian in the background, I suddenly felt very alone."

Mv "So you actually came… "

m "He looked at Sebastian in the background."

Mv "…but you didn’t come alone. Not a good sign for our talk if you start with a lie."

c "Sebastian insisted on coming with me to make sure we both are staying safe."

c "However, as you can see, he won’t be able to listen to us. "

Mv "Hmpf, whatever. So, why did you want to meet me? What is your plan in all of this? "

m "Maverick fixed me again with his intense gaze when I stood up but otherwise didn’t make any other movements."

c "I don’t have any ulterior motives if that is what you're asking."

Mv "So you want me to believe that your people found us by coincidence right after we discovered the portal or that your buddy Reza made his move right after you appeared here?"

m "He took a few steps closer to me and I had to fight the urge to back up."

Mv "I’ve been working for the police for years now and learned that there are no coincidences. You came here for a reason and your little meeting at the portal proves that you knew about the coded message."

c "I knew about it because he told me he would send me a message when we were at the cafe."

c "It took me several hours to actually find it."

Mv "So from all possible candidates you had, your leaders chose those who were friends?"

c "We don't have many people who'd be fitting to be an ambassador to meet a different species."

c "My experience in both biology and sociology made me a good fit."

c "Me and Reza being friends might have been a lucky coincidence for my people."

Mv angry flip "A likely story! Shall I list you all the {i}coincidences{/i} we have right now?"

Mv "Humans appearing right after we discover the portal."

Mv "Then they send two of people who turn out to be buddies."

Mv "To top all of that, right after the second human appears, someone gets murdered in an otherwise peaceful town which didn't have any murders for years."

Mv "I can see a conspiracy when it happens."

m "I was getting tired of this. Maverick had already made up his mind about me and it seemed that this meeting would lead nowhere."

m "Nevertheless, I gave it one last try."

c "It seems you already made up your mind so why don’t we skip all of this and you just tell me what you really want to say?"

Mv normal flip "Just tell me one thing: Why?"

Mv "What is your goal in all of this?"

Mv "Why even come here?"

c "You know why. We came as ambassadors for humanity and to oversee the trade we agreed on."

Mv "No, no, no. That won't do."

Mv "That's simply not true. You know it, and I know it. I just don't get why you can't be honest with me, even when you know no one else is listening."

Mv "You know I can't touch you. If I did, it would be over for me. At least, as long as I don't have any proof."

Mv "In the end, what difference does it make if I know? No one is going to believe me, anyway."

m "By now Maverick was getting as frustrated about this meeting as I was. While I tried to reason with him, he just refused to listen to me."

m "Maybe his time as a cop made him sense that I was still hiding an important detail."

m "Since this wasn’t going the way I hoped it was, I decided that it was time to interrupt Maverick."

m "He wasn’t wrong after all, there was more about my mission and maybe the truth could help him understand."

c "You are right, there is more to my mission but if your council would know about it, they could abuse that knowledge. " 

m "Maverick seemed to calm down a little and looked at me, his expression not showing any discernible emotion. "

Mv "I’m no politician and don’t care about their little games. All I want it is to make sure my people are safe. "

Mv "So whatever you’re telling me is staying between the two of us as long as it doesn’t affect the safety of my people."

c "I’m pretty much breaking every rule my people gave me but if it helps you to understand my mission…"

m "I let out a sigh."

c "It all started a few years ago…"

n "Years ago, we finally achieved what some would call a utopia. Crime rates dropped, we found cures for most illnesses and technology was at its peak."

n "With our advanced technology and unlimited access to information, we were able to study what we wanted to, no longer being forced to do hard or dangerous work thanks our advanced machines. "

n "In hindsight, it was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode and our time was running out faster than we realized." 

n "Then one day, unusual activities on the sun were captured by an automated monitoring system."

n "While at first it seemed like a harmless event, it soon turned out to be our downfall."

n "The activity had lead to a solar flare that was on its way to Earth and we had less than a week to prepare for it."

n "Our leaders always knew about the possibility of such an event but even after decades and hundreds of warnings from our scientists, they never actually prepared our civilization against our biggest weakness. "

n "Even though the solar flare itself was harmless for plants and animals, it was devastating for our technology."

n "As we had become too dependant on technology, we lost almost everything and the side effects  killed of around 15 percent of mankind during the event. The following years did the rest. "

n "Illnesses we thought we erased returned, old conflicts were reborn and soon war and destruction returned all over the world."

n "By now, most of mankind is gone and we don’t have any contact with other cities. "

n "Many people had turned to the remaining drugs and alcohol to escape reality for a short time, while others ended their own life. "

n "Outside of Bastion, the last known city with working technology and something close to a working government, raiders and looters are running wild, plundering and killing as much as they want." 

n "The discovery of the portal and the dragons became a beacon of hope, and the last chance for our town, maybe even for all of mankind, to survive."

m "Maverick was unusually quiet after I finished my story. He took a few steps away from me and I wasn’t sure what to expect next. Then he turned back to me. "

Mv "If what you’re saying is true, that it gives you even more reasons to betray our deal…"

m "I was trying to say something when he continued."

Mv "…on the other hand, you wouldn't be stupid enough to give me the perfect motive for your buddy’s actions."

c "…"

Mv "I of course can’t verify your story but Reza’s behavior is making more sense to me now. Including his gun and the usage of secret letters."

c "So you’re still thinking that I’m working with Reza?"

Mv "All I’m saying right now is that I could be wrong about you."

m "Hearing that was unexpected but maybe there actually was a chance for us to cooperate."

Mv "I don’t trust you yet but, if you want, I’ll give you another call soon. For now I have to think about everything. "

c "If you’re willing to give me a chance, then I’m not throwing it away. "

Mv "That’s good to know. "

Mv "For now we should act as if this meeting never happened. I trust Bryce’s judgment, but for some reason I feel as if I’m more useful when I’m not working as a police officer for this case."

Mv "Even if I hate working behind his back."

c "If you think that is the best way to solve this case, then I won't stand in your way. What about Sebastian? "

Mv "I’ll talk to him later. He is a smart, loyal officer and knows both of us. So if anything happens, he can help you to send me another letter. "

m "He turned around, ready to leave before he gave me a final look. This time however it felt as if I saw a hint of emotion in his eyes, as if he was actually starting to trust me. "

Mv "Maybe this meeting wasn’t a waste of time after all."
